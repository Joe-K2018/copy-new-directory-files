# copy-new-directory-files
Finds the most recent folder in a directory then copies all files within that are a specified file type to another specified directory.

Originally created for photos imported from a camera. This was used to copy the .jpg's into a separate folder, separated from the raw image files, for easy upload to a photo hosting service. Now can be used for any file type.

The source, destination, and file type can be set in the config file.
